## How to use

VS Code makes snippets easier to use, all you need to get started :

- Install Tailus Snippets [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TailusUI.snippus)
- Type `tailus-btn` for Buttons
- Type `tailus-cards` for Cards
- Type `tailus-navbar` for Navbars

Note that buttons contains many variants (size, emphasis, border-radius and icon placement), to use them eficiently include all variants in the prefix by separating with ":".

- eg `tailus-btn:lg:mde:leading` : size:lg emphasis:medium icon-placement:leading
- eg `tailus-btn:lg:low:unrounded:icon` : size:lg emphasis:low icon-placement:icon-only border-radius:unrounded

When you don't include a variant, the snippet will use the default values
